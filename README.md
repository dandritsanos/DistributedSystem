# DistributedSystem
It's a simple distributed system, the client is communicating with the sevrer through TCP sockets. 
This project is based on Distributed Systems course in Economics University of Athens in 2023 (ExerciseDS).
The client is represented as an Android application communicating with a Java sevrer through TCP sockets. 
On server side, master is communicating with workers through TCP sockets. Functionality of the system 
is baseed on the Map-Reduce data proccessing. This model can be very usefull for large scale data processing.
